# Kibana-Reporting
Reporting feature on X-Pack helps you Generate, Schedule &amp; Email Reports but this don't come free with your Kibana package, you have to buy X-Pack to get this great feature. The unfortunate thing there is feature is not as great as the one provide by skledler but is also not free. But this is a code I have written to do this for free and save your company thousands of dollars if not millions in a year in the name of automating reports to stakeholders in your organization.
I have two reasons for written these codes one is because I love saving money for my company and the other is I love open source.

If you are familiar with Kibana X-Pack Reporting you notice that it always print two visualizations a page and at the footer you will find elastic logo. This does not make sense to me as you have paid for this, you can change this logo by visiting the code from plugin directory but it doesnt worth it.

So I have created a script that give you the same report-look as skedler and all you need to do is to edit it to your needs and configure a cronjob which I will show you an example. You get report send to your stakeholders at your specified time via email in PDF format.

If you are having trouble implementing these codes OR you need to join your BI Team.
Iif you need help with other reporting format.
